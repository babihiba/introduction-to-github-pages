---When you start to draw from life it is always difficult to see how to make the three-dimensional image in front of you fit onto the paper without it looking awkward, stiff, inaccurate or flat. There is no avoiding this exercise, however, if you want to find out whether you have real drawing ability.

In this section we’ll be looking at a range of subjects as they really are: agglomerations of shapes. As well as the shapes of the things themselves, you will notice the shapes between things. There are no spaces in drawing or painting, just other areas of tone. You will find with the subjects you choose that the shapes butt up tightly to one another. Look at the whole image with interest and without preconception.

Try to notice everything and don’t regard one part of the whole as superior to the rest. It is not.
